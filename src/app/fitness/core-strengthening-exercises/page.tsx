        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          In kickboxing, core strength is the foundation of stability, power, and balance. A strong core improves your ability to throw strikes, absorb hits, and maintain control during footwork or clinches. Beyond aesthetics, a well-trained core translates to better performance and injury prevention.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Below, we’ll explore five evidence-based core exercises specifically tailored to enhance your stability in kickboxing. These exercises, championed by elite fighters and supported by sports science, will help you maintain control and power in the ring.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Core Strength is Critical for Kickboxers</h2>
        <p>
          Every punch, kick, or defensive move you perform begins with the core. It’s the link between your upper and lower body, enabling the efficient transfer of energy. A weak core can lead to imbalance, reduced power, and a higher risk of injury.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Key Benefits of Core Training:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>Improved Striking Power:</strong> A strong core allows for better rotation and torque, generating more force in punches and kicks.</li>
          <li><strong>Enhanced Stability:</strong> Maintain balance during strikes, footwork, and clinches.</li>
          <li><strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Strengthening the core reduces stress on the lower back and hips.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in the <em>Journal of Sports Sciences</em> (2019) found that core strength significantly impacts balance, power, and agility in combat sports athletes.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Plank Variations</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** The plank is a staple core exercise, targeting the transverse abdominis, rectus abdominis, and obliques. Variations like side planks and dynamic planks add extra challenge and specificity for fighters.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Standard Plank: Hold for 30-60 seconds, focusing on a straight line from head to heels.</li>
          <li>Side Plank: Hold each side for 30 seconds, keeping hips elevated.</li>
          <li>Dynamic Plank: Alternate between forearms and hands for 30 seconds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Research in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> (2020) showed that plank variations improve core stability and endurance.  
          **Trainer Insight:** Muay Thai legend Buakaw Banchamek incorporates plank variations to build balance and core control for high kicks.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Russian Twists</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Russian twists target the obliques and rotational muscles, essential for generating torque in punches and kicks.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Sit on the floor with knees bent and feet elevated.</li>
          <li>Hold a weight or medicine ball and twist your torso, touching the weight to the floor on each side.</li>
          <li>Perform 3 sets of 20 twists (10 per side).</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A 2018 study in <em>Sports Biomechanics</em> highlighted the role of rotational core strength in improving striking mechanics.  
          **Trainer Tip:** Boxing coach Freddie Roach often includes Russian twists in conditioning circuits to sharpen rotational power.
