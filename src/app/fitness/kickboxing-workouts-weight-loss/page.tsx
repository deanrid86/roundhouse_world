        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Kickboxing is Effective for Weight Loss</h2>
        <p>
          Kickboxing combines high-intensity cardio with strength training, making it an excellent workout for burning calories and building lean muscle. The dynamic movements—punches, kicks, and footwork—engage multiple muscle groups, increasing energy expenditure.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Key Benefits for Weight Loss:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>High Calorie Burn:</strong> A 60-minute session can burn 600-800 calories, depending on intensity.</li>
          <li><strong>Muscle Engagement:</strong> Builds lean muscle, which increases resting metabolic rate (RMR).</li>
          <li><strong>Interval Training:</strong> Kickboxing naturally incorporates bursts of high-intensity activity, boosting fat loss.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in the <em>Journal of Sports Science</em> (2020) found that kickboxing improves body composition by reducing fat mass and increasing lean muscle.
