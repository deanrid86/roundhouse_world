        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Diaphragmatic Breathing</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Diaphragmatic breathing, also known as belly breathing, engages the diaphragm to maximize lung capacity and oxygen intake. It’s a foundational technique for endurance athletes.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Practice:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Sit or lie down in a comfortable position.</li>
          <li>Place one hand on your chest and the other on your stomach.</li>
          <li>Inhale deeply through your nose, ensuring your stomach rises while your chest remains still.</li>
          <li>Exhale slowly through your mouth, allowing your stomach to fall.</li>
          <li>Practice for 5-10 minutes daily.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Research in the <em>Journal of Sports Medicine</em> (2020) showed that diaphragmatic breathing improves oxygen delivery and reduces perceived exertion during physical activity.  
          **Trainer Insight:** Phil Daru recommends diaphragmatic breathing for fighters to stay calm and conserve energy during intense bouts.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Box Breathing for Calm and Control</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Box breathing is a controlled breathing technique that helps fighters manage stress, maintain focus, and enhance endurance by regulating oxygen levels.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Practice:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds.</li>
          <li>Hold your breath for 4 seconds.</li>
          <li>Exhale slowly through your mouth for 4 seconds.</li>
          <li>Hold your breath for another 4 seconds.</li>
          <li>Repeat for 5-10 cycles before training or between rounds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Studies in <em>Frontiers in Psychology</em> (2021) found that box breathing reduces cortisol levels and improves concentration during high-stress situations.  
          **Fighter Insight:** Former UFC champion Georges St-Pierre uses box breathing to maintain composure under pressure.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Nasal Breathing for Efficiency</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Nasal breathing enhances oxygen intake efficiency, filters the air, and encourages a steady breathing rhythm during prolonged exertion.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Practice:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>During training or low-intensity activity, breathe exclusively through your nose.</li>
          <li>Focus on keeping a steady pace to avoid the urge to switch to mouth breathing.</li>
          <li>Incorporate nasal breathing into warm-ups and cool-downs to build tolerance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Research in <em>European Journal of Applied Physiology</em> (2020) showed that nasal breathing improves oxygen efficiency and reduces fatigue.  
          **Trainer Insight:** Many endurance athletes and fighters use nasal breathing to enhance energy conservation during long sessions.

          <li>Exhale sharply through your mouth with each strike.</li>
          <li>Maintain a consistent rhythm to avoid holding your breath under stress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A 2019 study in the <em>Journal of Combat Sports</em> found that rhythmic breathing improves striking efficiency and reduces energy expenditure.  
          **Trainer Tip:** Elite trainers often teach rhythmic breathing as a way to maintain composure and power during long sparring sessions.
