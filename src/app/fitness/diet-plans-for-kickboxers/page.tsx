        <p>
          **Description:** Carb cycling involves adjusting carbohydrate intake based on training intensity. High-carb days fuel intense workouts, while low-carb days promote fat burning and recovery.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How It Works:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">

          <li>Maintain consistent protein and healthy fat intake throughout the week.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
