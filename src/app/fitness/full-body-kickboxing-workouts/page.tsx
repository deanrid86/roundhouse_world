        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Shadow Boxing Circuits</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Shadow boxing involves throwing punches, kicks, knees, and elbows into the air while maintaining proper technique and footwork. It’s a low-impact way to drill fundamentals and boost cardiovascular health.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Sample Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>2 minutes of steady shadow boxing (light jabs, crosses, hooks, front kicks)</li>
          <li>30 seconds of high-intensity combos (rapid-fire punches, followed by a set of front kicks)</li>
          <li>1 minute rest and repeat for 5-6 rounds</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Research in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> (2015) shows that shadow boxing can improve aerobic capacity and coordination.  
          **Fighter Insight:** Former UFC champion Georges St-Pierre has praised shadow boxing for refining technique and ensuring fighters maintain proper form under fatigue.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Bodyweight Conditioning Rounds</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Bodyweight exercises build functional strength and endurance without the need for equipment. Squats, lunges, push-ups, and burpees mimic the explosive movements in kickboxing.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Sample Protocol (Perform in a Circuit):**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>10 Squats (drive through the heels, engage glutes and quads)</li>
          <li>10 Push-Ups (focus on core stability and upper body strength)</li>
          <li>10 Lunges (each leg, improving unilateral leg strength)</li>
          <li>10 Burpees (boost cardiovascular endurance)</li>
          <li>Rest 60 seconds and repeat for 4-5 sets</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Studies in <em>Sports Medicine</em> (2019) highlight that bodyweight circuits improve muscular endurance and anaerobic capacity—key elements for repeated striking.  
          **Trainer Tip:** Phil Daru (Strength & Conditioning coach for MMA fighters) emphasizes the importance of bodyweight drills for building a strong base and preventing injuries.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Kickboxing Tabata Sessions</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Tabata, a form of High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), involves 20 seconds of maximum-effort exercise followed by 10 seconds of rest, repeated for 8 rounds (4 minutes total). Applying this format to kickboxing moves—like jab-cross combos or roundhouse kicks—quickly improves cardiovascular conditioning.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Sample Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Round 1: 20 seconds of alternating front kicks (max effort), 10s rest</li>
          <li>Round 2: 20 seconds of rapid jab-cross combos, 10s rest</li>
          <li>Round 3: 20 seconds of squats, 10s rest</li>
          <li>Round 4: 20 seconds of knee strikes, 10s rest</li>
          <li>Repeat this 4-round cycle twice for a total of 8 intervals</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in <em>Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise</em> (1996) introduced Tabata intervals, noting significant VO2 max improvements. HIIT increases metabolic rate and simulates the intensity bursts seen in a fight.  
          **Fighter Insight:** Many professional fighters integrate HIIT to improve their gas tank, allowing them to maintain power and speed in later rounds.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Resistance Band Combos</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Resistance bands add progressive tension to punches and kicks, building explosive strength and enhancing technique. They mimic the resistance felt when striking an opponent or a bag, even in a home setting.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Sample Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>3 sets of 10 band-resisted punches (wrap the band around your back and hold ends in each hand)</li>
          <li>3 sets of 10 band-resisted front kicks (anchor band under a stable object, loop around foot)</li>
          <li>2 sets of 10 band-resisted roundhouse kicks each leg</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A review in <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> (2020) shows resistance training can enhance striking force and speed.  
          **Coach Endorsement:** Renowned boxing coach Freddie Roach has mentioned that resistance work can add snap to punches and improve overall conditioning.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Footwork and Agility Drills</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Quick, agile footwork improves ring control and strike setup. Using ladder drills, lateral shuffles, and pivot steps at home develops lower-body strength, balance, and coordination.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Sample Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>3 sets of lateral shuffles (10 meters down and back, focusing on staying light on the toes)</li>
          <li>3 sets of forward-backward ladder drills (or imaginary lines if you don’t have a ladder)</li>
          <li>2 sets of pivot drills: stand in fight stance, pivot 90° left and right at a moderate speed for 30 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Balance and agility training improves proprioception and reaction time, per a study in <em>Gait & Posture</em> (2017).  
          **Fighter Insight:** Dominick Cruz, known for his footwork in MMA, emphasizes agility drills to stay elusive and set up strikes effectively.
