        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Foam Rolling</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Foam rolling, or self-myofascial release, targets tight muscles and fascia, improving blood flow and reducing soreness. It’s a simple yet highly effective tool for recovery.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Perform:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Roll slowly over tight areas like quads, hamstrings, and calves.</li>
          <li>Spend 30-60 seconds on each muscle group.</li>
          <li>Pause on tender spots to release tension.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in the <em>Journal of Athletic Training</em> (2020) found that foam rolling improves range of motion and reduces muscle soreness post-exercise.  
          **Trainer Insight:** Many fighters, including Israel Adesanya, incorporate foam rolling into their recovery to stay agile and injury-free.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Static Stretching</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Static stretching enhances flexibility, reduces muscle stiffness, and promotes relaxation, making it ideal for post-training recovery.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Perform:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Hold stretches for 20-30 seconds, focusing on major muscle groups like hamstrings, quads, and shoulders.</li>
          <li>Avoid bouncing or forcing the stretch.</li>
          <li>Breathe deeply to encourage muscle relaxation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A 2018 review in <em>Sports Medicine</em> confirmed that static stretching improves flexibility and reduces post-exercise soreness.  
          **Fighter Insight:** Muay Thai champion Buakaw Banchamek uses stretching routines to maintain his iconic kicking flexibility and recovery.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Contrast Showers</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** Alternating between hot and cold water in the shower improves circulation, reduces inflammation, and speeds up recovery.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">

          <li>Spend 1-2 minutes in hot water (not scalding).</li>
          <li>Switch to cold water for 30-60 seconds.</li>
          <li>Repeat for 3-5 cycles, ending with cold water.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> (2016) found that contrast therapy reduces post-exercise muscle damage and inflammation.  
          **Fighter Insight:** Former UFC champion Georges St-Pierre advocates for contrast showers as part of his recovery protocol.
