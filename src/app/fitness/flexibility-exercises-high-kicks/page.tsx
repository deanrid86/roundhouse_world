        <p>
          **Description:** Dynamic leg swings are a proven way to loosen the hip flexors, hamstrings, and glutes while preparing your body for high kicks. This dynamic warm-up increases flexibility through movement, which is crucial for kicking.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Perform:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Stand next to a wall or chair for support.</li>
          <li>Swing one leg forward and backward, keeping it straight but relaxed.</li>
          <li>Perform 10-15 swings per leg.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Studies in the <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> (2014) highlight dynamic stretching as superior for pre-workout flexibility.  
          **Fighter Insight:** K-1 Champion Andy Hug famously incorporated dynamic leg swings into his pre-fight routines to maintain kicking speed and range.

        <p>
          **Description:** This classic stretch targets the hamstrings and lower back, both essential for achieving higher kicks. It also promotes relaxation and improves overall flexibility when done regularly.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Perform:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Sit on the floor with your legs extended straight out.</li>
          <li>Reach forward with your hands, aiming to touch your toes or beyond.</li>
          <li>Hold the position for 20-30 seconds and repeat 2-3 times.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A 2016 review in <em>Sports Medicine</em> found static stretching beneficial for long-term flexibility gains when held for 20-30 seconds.  
          **Trainer Tip:** Phil Daru advises fighters to incorporate seated forward folds post-training to improve flexibility and promote recovery.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Butterfly Stretch</h2>
        <p>
          **Description:** The butterfly stretch focuses on the inner thighs and hip adductors, critical for lateral high kicks like roundhouses. It’s simple yet highly effective for improving hip mobility.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **How to Perform:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
