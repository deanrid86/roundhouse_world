        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why HIIT is Perfect for Kickboxers</h2>
        <p>
          Kickboxing rounds demand intense bursts of energy followed by brief recovery periods—exactly what HIIT is designed to replicate. Whether you’re throwing flurries of strikes or defending against an onslaught, HIIT helps condition your body for these fight-specific energy demands.
