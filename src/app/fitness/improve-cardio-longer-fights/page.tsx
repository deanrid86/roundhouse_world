        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Cardio Matters for Kickboxers</h2>
        <p>
          Effective cardio training enhances your aerobic and anaerobic systems, allowing you to sustain high-intensity movements over multiple rounds. Good cardiovascular health improves oxygen delivery to muscles, delays fatigue, and speeds recovery between explosive efforts.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Key Benefits of Improved Cardio:**
        </p>

          <li><strong>Longer Fight Endurance:</strong> Maintain technique and power in late rounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Faster Recovery:</strong> Reduce fatigue during rest periods and between sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Improved Mental Focus:</strong> Prevent exhaustion from clouding decision-making.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A study in the <em>Journal of Combat Sports</em> (2020) confirmed that improved cardio correlates with higher output and accuracy in prolonged bouts.

          <li>Repeat for 10 rounds (10 minutes total).</li>
          <li>Increase rounds or decrease rest time as you progress.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** A 2020 study in <em>Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research</em> showed that HIIT improves both aerobic power and recovery time in combat athletes.
