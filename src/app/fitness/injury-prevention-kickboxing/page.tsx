        <p>
          **Description:** A proper warm-up increases blood flow, prepares muscles for movement, and reduces injury risk. Cooling down aids recovery and prevents stiffness.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Protocol:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Warm-Up: Spend 10-15 minutes on dynamic stretches (e.g., leg swings, arm circles) and light cardio (e.g., jogging or jump rope).</li>
          <li>Cool-Down: After training, perform static stretches (e.g., hamstring or quad stretches) and deep breathing for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Evidence:** Research in the <em>Journal of Sports Medicine</em> (2020) found that warming up reduces muscle stiffness and improves flexibility, decreasing the likelihood of injuries.  
          **Trainer Insight:** Phil Daru emphasizes the importance of warm-ups and cool-downs as &quot;non-negotiables&quot; for combat athletes.
