        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Technique Breakdown (Step-by-Step)</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Stance & Alignment:</strong> Begin in your fighting stance with knees slightly bent, weight evenly distributed, and guard up. Ensure your feet are shoulder-width apart for balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Chamber the Knee:</strong> Lift your rear leg’s knee toward your target, keeping your upper body upright. Your hips should start rotating toward the target as you pivot on the supporting foot.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Hip Rotation & Extension:</strong> Rotate your hips and pivot on the ball of your supporting foot. Extend your kicking leg, striking the target with the shin or instep. Keep your toes pointed and your knee slightly bent at impact.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Follow-Through & Recovery:</strong> After impact, retract your leg quickly and return to your stance. Maintain your guard and be ready to throw another strike or move defensively.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Common Mistakes & How to Fix Them</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Dropping the Guard:</strong> Many beginners lower their hands during the kick. Instead, keep one hand up near your face and the other extended slightly for balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lack of Hip Rotation:</strong> Without proper hip rotation, you lose power. Focus on pivoting fully on your supporting foot so your hips drive the strike.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Overreaching:</strong> Don’t lean too far forward or backward. Keep your torso upright and let your leg and hips do the work.
          </li>
        </ul>

      {/* Applications and Variations */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">When & How to Use the Roundhouse Kick</h2>
        <p>
          The roundhouse is excellent for mid-range striking, often set up with jabs or push kicks. Variations include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>Low Roundhouse (Leg Kick):</strong> Target the opponent’s thigh to wear them down over time.</li>
          <li><strong>Body Roundhouse:</strong> Aim at the ribs or liver area to reduce their endurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Head Roundhouse:</strong> A more advanced, flexible option that can score decisive points or even achieve a knockout.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Consider throwing a roundhouse after a jab-cross combination to catch your opponent off-guard, or use feints to draw them into range.

      {/* Technical Tips from Pros */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Expert Insights & Biomechanics</h2>
        <p>
          **Coach Insight:** Renowned Muay Thai trainer Saenchai emphasizes hip rotation and a relaxed upper body for maximum power. “Focus on whipping your hips through the target, not just swinging your leg,” he advises.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Science Spotlight:** Studies in the <em>Journal of Sports Biomechanics</em> (2021) indicate that a properly executed roundhouse kick can generate force up to several times the kicker’s body weight, thanks to the kinetic chain from the pivoting foot through the hip rotation to the striking limb.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            <strong>Slow-Motion Reps:</strong> Practice the movement slowly without power. Focus on form, balance, and full hip rotation.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Pad Work:</strong> Have a partner hold Thai pads at different heights. Perform 10 roundhouse kicks per leg, focusing on accuracy and consistent technique.
