      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Dropping Your Guard</h2>
        <p>
          **Mistake:** Dropping your hands after throwing punches or kicks leaves your face and body exposed, making you vulnerable to counterattacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Keep your guard up at all times. After every strike, ensure your hands return to their protective position near your face. Practice shadowboxing with a focus on maintaining your guard, even when fatigued.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Use focus mitt drills where your partner counters immediately if you drop your guard to build reflexive protection.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Poor Footwork</h2>
        <p>
          **Mistake:** Standing flat-footed or crossing your feet during movement reduces balance and limits your ability to generate power or evade strikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Focus on staying light on your toes and using small, controlled steps. Practice basic footwork drills like lateral shuffles and pivoting to improve mobility and balance.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Shadowbox with cones or markers to simulate precise movement patterns.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Overreaching on Punches</h2>
        <p>
          **Mistake:** Leaning too far forward during punches sacrifices balance and reduces power. It also leaves you open to counters.
        </p>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Maintain proper distance by using your footwork to close the gap rather than leaning. Focus on pivoting your hips and shoulders to generate power while keeping your weight balanced.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Drill:** Practice on the heavy bag, ensuring your punches land without overextending. Gradually increase power while maintaining form.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Telegraphing Your Strikes</h2>
        <p>
          **Mistake:** Showing obvious signs before striking, such as pulling back your arm or pausing before a kick, alerts your opponent to your intentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Focus on fluid, non-telegraphed movements. Use feints and subtle weight shifts to disguise your true intentions.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Drill:** Shadowbox in front of a mirror to identify and eliminate telegraphed movements.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Neglecting the Non-Dominant Side</h2>
        <p>
          **Mistake:** Over-reliance on your dominant hand or leg creates predictable patterns and weakens your overall game.
        </p>
        <p>
          **Fix:** Incorporate drills specifically for your non-dominant side, such as single-side pad work or focused combinations.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Dedicate an entire round of shadowboxing or bag work to your non-dominant side to build strength and coordination.
