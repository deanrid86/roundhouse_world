        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Mechanics of the Perfect Jab</h2>
        <p>The perfect jab is a combination of speed, accuracy, and power, relying on proper technique and body mechanics:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Stance:** Begin in a balanced fighting stance with your guard up and weight evenly distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Push-Off:** Use the ball of your lead foot to push off slightly, generating forward momentum.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Straight Line:** Extend your lead arm in a straight line toward the target, keeping your elbow tucked.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Rotation:** Rotate your shoulder and hips slightly to add power and range to your jab.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Snap Back:** Retract your hand immediately after impact to maintain guard and prepare for follow-ups.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Keep your chin tucked and your rear hand up to protect against counters.

      {/* The Physics of the Jab */}

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Physics of the Jab</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding the physics behind the jab can help you refine your technique:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Force:** Power in a jab comes from acceleration and the efficient transfer of weight from your lower body to your fist.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Leverage:** A straight line minimizes energy loss, allowing for maximum impact with minimal effort.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Timing:** Delivering the jab at the perfect moment increases its effectiveness, whether to disrupt an attack or exploit an opening.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Kinetic Chain:** The jab utilizes the kinetic chain, starting from the feet and flowing through the legs, hips, torso, shoulder, and arm.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            **Mirror Shadowboxing:** Use a mirror to monitor your jab’s alignment, speed, and snap-back.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Focus Mitt Work:** Practice precision and speed with a partner holding focus mitts.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Speed Bag Training:** Develop rhythm and hand speed by working on the speed bag.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Timed Rounds:** Perform 3-minute rounds of continuous jabbing on a heavy bag to build endurance and consistency.
