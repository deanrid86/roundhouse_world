        <p>
          Power generation starts from the ground up, utilizing the kinetic chain to transfer energy from your feet to your fist. Here’s how to break it down:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Proper Stance:** Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, knees slightly bent, and weight evenly distributed for balance.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Ground Force:** Push off the ball of your rear foot to create energy and momentum.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Hip Rotation:** Rotate your hips explosively toward the target, transferring power through your torso.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Shoulder Drive:** Engage your shoulders and extend your punching arm fully while maintaining alignment with your torso.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Follow-Through:** Drive your fist through the target, keeping your wrist straight and your fist tightly clenched at impact.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Keep your non-punching hand up to protect your head while generating power.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Drills to Build Punching Power</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Heavy Bag Power Rounds:** Perform 3-minute rounds on a heavy bag, focusing on single, powerful punches. Alternate between jabs, crosses, hooks, and uppercuts.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Plyometric Push-Ups:** Perform explosive push-ups where your hands leave the ground at the top of each rep. This builds the fast-twitch muscle fibers critical for punch power.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Resistance Band Punches:** Attach a resistance band to a sturdy anchor and perform punches against the resistance to improve explosiveness and endurance.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Medicine Ball Throws:** Throw a medicine ball against a wall or to a partner using a punching motion. This develops rotational power and strengthens the core.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Focus Mitt Drills:** Work with a partner holding focus mitts. Practice delivering sharp, powerful strikes with precision and control.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Mistake:** Overreliance on Arm Strength  
            **Fix:** Focus on engaging your hips and legs to drive the punch. Power should flow through your entire body, not just your arm.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Mistake:** Poor Wrist Alignment  
            **Fix:** Keep your wrist straight and your fist tightly clenched to avoid injury and maximize power transfer.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Mistake:** Lack of Follow-Through  
            **Fix:** Visualize punching through your target, not just to it. This mindset helps maintain proper momentum.
