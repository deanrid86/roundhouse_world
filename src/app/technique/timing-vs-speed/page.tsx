Speed allows you to strike first and react quickly, while timing enables you to exploit openings and land effective counters. Mastering the balance between timing and speed is what separates good fighters from great ones.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Speed:** Refers to how fast you can execute a technique or react to an opponent’s movement. It’s crucial for initiating attacks, countering, and avoiding strikes.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Timing:** Refers to executing a technique at the perfect moment, capitalizing on openings, and disrupting your opponent’s rhythm.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Relationship:** While speed allows you to act quickly, timing ensures those actions are precise and impactful.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Example:** A fast punch without proper timing might miss or hit a guarded target, while a slower punch executed with perfect timing can catch your opponent off-balance and deliver more damage.
