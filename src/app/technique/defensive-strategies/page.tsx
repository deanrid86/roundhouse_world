          Defense is just as important as offense in kickboxing. Parrying and blocking are two essential techniques that allow you to neutralize your opponent’s attacks, conserve energy, and create opportunities for counterstrikes. While blocking provides a sturdy shield, parrying requires finesse and timing to redirect incoming strikes.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Mechanics of Blocking</h2>
        <p>
          **Blocking** involves using your arms, hands, and sometimes legs to absorb or deflect an opponent’s strike. A solid block minimizes the impact of the strike and protects vital areas like your head and torso.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Key Techniques:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>**High Guard Block:** Raise your hands to protect your head while keeping your elbows close to your body to shield your torso.</li>
          <li>**Elbow Block:** Use your elbow to absorb kicks targeting the ribs or midsection. Rotate your torso slightly to brace for impact.</li>
          <li>**Leg Check:** Lift your lead leg to block low kicks, ensuring your shin meets the strike at an angle.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Always keep your eyes on your opponent while blocking to anticipate follow-up attacks.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Mechanics of Parrying</h2>
        <p>
          **Parrying** is a more dynamic defensive technique that involves redirecting an opponent’s strike away from your body. It requires precise timing and fluid movements.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Key Techniques:**
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>**Straight Punch Parry:** Use your rear hand to push the opponent’s jab or cross slightly off-center, opening them up for counters.</li>
          <li>**Hook Parry:** Raise your lead hand to deflect hooks, creating space to evade or counter.</li>
          <li>**Kick Parry:** Redirect incoming kicks using your forearm or shin, ensuring you stay balanced and ready to retaliate.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Combine parrying with footwork to create angles for counterattacks.
