      {/* Technique Comparisons */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Key Technique Comparisons</h2>
        <p>While Muay Thai and kickboxing share some foundational techniques, their execution and focus differ significantly:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Strikes:** Muay Thai utilizes eight points of contact (punches, kicks, elbows, knees), while kickboxing primarily focuses on punches and kicks.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Clinching:** Muay Thai clinching is a key component, allowing fighters to control opponents, land knees, and execute sweeps. Clinching is largely prohibited in kickboxing.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Stance:** Muay Thai stances are more upright to facilitate balance for clinching and checking kicks. Kickboxing stances are more dynamic, emphasizing lateral movement and speed.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Defensive Techniques:** Muay Thai emphasizes blocks, parries, and checks. Kickboxing often incorporates head movement and footwork borrowed from Western boxing.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Kicks:** Muay Thai kicks are delivered with the shin and rely on full hip rotation for maximum power. Kickboxing includes a wider variety of kicks, such as sidekicks and spinning kicks.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      {/* Strategy and Rules */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Strategy and Rules</h2>
        <p>The rulesets of Muay Thai and kickboxing significantly influence their strategies:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Muay Thai:** Fighters often adopt a measured approach, using the early rounds to gauge their opponent before ramping up intensity. Points are awarded for effective strikes, balance, and control.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Kickboxing:** Matches are typically faster-paced due to shorter round durations and the absence of clinching. Fighters aim to dominate with combinations and high output.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Scoring:** Muay Thai scoring places emphasis on clean, effective strikes and damage inflicted. Kickboxing scoring rewards volume and combinations.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>

          <li>
            **Kickboxing:** While originating in Japan, modern kickboxing has a global appeal, with influences from karate, Western boxing, and Muay Thai.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Training:** Muay Thai training often includes heavy focus on clinching, conditioning, and repetitive drills on heavy bags. Kickboxing training emphasizes combinations, agility, and speed.
