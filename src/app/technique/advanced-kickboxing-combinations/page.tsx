        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Jab-Cross-Switch Kick</h2>
        <p>
          **How It Works:** This combination starts with a standard jab-cross to set up your opponent and closes with a switch kick to catch them off guard. The switch kick is particularly effective at targeting the opponent’s midsection or legs.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Execution Steps:**
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Throw a sharp jab to close the distance and disrupt your opponent’s guard.</li>
          <li>Follow with a powerful cross, aiming to shift their weight backward.</li>
          <li>Immediately switch your stance and fire a kick with your rear leg, targeting their open side.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Focus on speed and fluidity when transitioning from the cross to the switch kick.  
          **Drill:** Practice this combo on Thai pads to refine timing and power.
        </p>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Cross-Hook-Low Kick</h2>
        <p>
          **How It Works:** This combination uses a cross to draw attention to the upper body, a hook to disorient, and a low kick to destabilize the opponent.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Execution Steps:**
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">

          <li>Rotate your hips and follow up with a hook to their temple or guard.</li>
          <li>Finish with a low kick to the lead leg, aiming for the thigh or calf.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Keep your guard up during the hook to avoid counters.  
          **Drill:** Use heavy bags to build power and precision with the low kick.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Feint-Jab-Overhand Right</h2>
        <p>
          **How It Works:** A feint sets up this deceptive combo, drawing your opponent’s guard down before landing a powerful overhand right.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Execution Steps:**
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Feint a low kick or body shot to force a reaction from your opponent.</li>
          <li>Throw a quick jab to their face, disrupting their guard.</li>
          <li>Finish with an overhand right aimed at the temple or chin.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Feint convincingly to sell the deception and create openings.  
          **Drill:** Practice this combination during sparring to improve timing and effectiveness.

        <p className="mt-2">

        </p>

          <li>Follow with a rear uppercut, aiming for the chin or body.</li>
          <li>Step into range and land a body kick with your rear leg, targeting the ribs or liver.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
