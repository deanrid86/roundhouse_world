        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Stay on the Balls of Your Feet:** This position allows for quick directional changes and keeps you light on your feet.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Maintain Proper Stance:** Your feet should be shoulder-width apart, with knees slightly bent and weight evenly distributed.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Move, Don’t Bounce:** Avoid unnecessary bouncing; instead, use controlled, deliberate movements to conserve energy.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Circle, Don’t Retreat:** When avoiding an attack, circle your opponent rather than moving straight back to maintain an advantageous angle.
