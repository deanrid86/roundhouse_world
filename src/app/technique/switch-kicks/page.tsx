        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">The Mechanics of the Switch Kick</h2>
        <p>
          The switch kick derives its power and effectiveness from a quick stance switch that generates momentum. Here&apos;s how to perform it step by step:
        </p>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside mt-2">
          <li>Start in your fighting stance with your weight evenly distributed.</li>
          <li>
            Perform a quick switch of your feet: your rear foot moves forward while your lead foot steps back. This creates momentum for the kick.
          </li>
          <li>
            As you switch, rotate your hips and prepare to lift your rear leg for the kick.
          </li>
          <li>
            Extend your kicking leg, aiming to strike with the shin or instep. Rotate on the ball of your supporting foot to maximize hip rotation.
          </li>
          <li>Follow through and quickly return to your fighting stance to reset.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Pro Tip:** Keep your upper body relaxed during the switch for fluidity and balance.
        </p>

      {/* Timing and Application */}
      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">When to Use the Switch Kick</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li>
            **Closing the Distance:** Use the switch kick to cover ground quickly and land a strike when your opponent is just out of range.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Setting Up Combos:** Integrate the switch kick into combinations to add variety and keep your opponent guessing.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Against Aggressive Opponents:** The switch kick is ideal for interrupting forward momentum, particularly with a body or leg kick.
          </li>
          <li>
            **Deceptive Attacks:** The stance switch can disguise your intentions, making it harder for your opponent to predict the target.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          **Example:** Follow a jab-cross combo with a switch kick to the body for a seamless transition between strikes.
