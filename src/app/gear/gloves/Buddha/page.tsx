            <li>
              <strong>Synthetic Material:</strong> While durable, the use of synthetic leather may not provide the same 
              feel or longevity as genuine leather gloves.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Break-In Period:</strong> Some users report that the gloves require a break-in period to achieve 
              optimal comfort and flexibility.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limited Availability:</strong> As a special edition model, these gloves may have limited stock, 
              making them less accessible for some customers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Price Point:</strong> The special edition and handmade aspects may result in a higher price compared 
              to standard models, which could be a consideration for budget-conscious buyers.
