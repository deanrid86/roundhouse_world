      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Combat sports, such as kickboxing, Muay Thai, MMA, and boxing, demand a high level of athleticism: speed, strength, endurance, and mental focus. Achieving and maintaining peak performance often hinges on more than just training and macronutrient intake. Electrolytes—minerals like sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium—play a critical role in hydration, muscle function, and nervous system balance.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          Understanding and managing your electrolyte levels can help combat athletes optimize their training sessions, reduce cramping, and maintain stable energy levels throughout intense bouts of activity.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Are Electrolytes?</h2>
        <p>
          Electrolytes are electrically charged minerals that support numerous physiological processes. Key electrolytes include:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>Sodium:</strong> Helps regulate fluid balance, blood pressure, and muscle contraction.</li>
          <li><strong>Potassium:</strong> Supports nerve function, muscle contraction, and heart rhythm regulation.</li>
          <li><strong>Magnesium:</strong> Involved in muscle relaxation, energy production, and over 300 enzymatic reactions.</li>
          <li><strong>Calcium:</strong> Essential for muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and bone health.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mt-2">
          For combat athletes, an optimal balance of these electrolytes ensures that muscles fire correctly, nerves communicate efficiently, and the body maintains proper hydration status.

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Why Electrolytes Matter in Combat Sports</h2>
        <p>
          Combat training is often characterized by intense, repetitive movements, heavy sweating, and high mental demands. As you sweat, you lose not just water but also crucial electrolytes—particularly sodium and potassium. This electrolyte loss can lead to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>Muscle Cramps and Fatigue:</strong> Low electrolyte levels can cause involuntary muscle contractions and premature fatigue, limiting power output and endurance.</li>
          <li><strong>Decreased Mental Sharpness:</strong> Electrolyte imbalances affect nerve function, potentially impacting reaction time, focus, and decision-making in the ring.</li>
          <li><strong>Reduced Performance Over Time:</strong> Chronic electrolyte deficiencies can erode overall performance, slow recovery, and diminish training quality.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section className="mb-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Scientific Backing</h2>
        <p>
          Research published in the <em>Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition</em> (JISSN) supports the importance of maintaining electrolyte balance for athletes. Another study in the <em>Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports</em> (2010) found that adequate sodium and fluid replacement improved exercise performance and reduced perceived exertion in endurance athletes.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          While many studies focus on endurance sports, the principles apply to combat athletes who also experience substantial sweat loss and engage in sustained, high-intensity efforts.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Practical Strategies for Maintaining Electrolyte Balance</h2>
        <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
          <li>
            <strong>Pre-Hydration:</strong> Start training sessions with adequate electrolyte levels. Consider a balanced electrolyte beverage or adding a pinch of high-quality salt to your pre-workout meal.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4">
            <strong>Intra-Workout Beverages:</strong> During longer sessions (over 60 minutes), consuming an electrolyte-rich drink can help maintain steady levels. Products with sodium, potassium, and magnesium are especially beneficial.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4">
            <strong>Recovery Meals:</strong> Post-training, replenish electrolytes with whole foods like bananas (potassium), spinach (magnesium), and Greek yogurt (calcium). A light sprinkling of sea salt can help recover sodium.
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4">
            <strong>Supplementation:</strong> If whole food options are limited, quality electrolyte tablets, powders, or capsules can ensure consistent intake. Aim for products with transparent labeling and appropriate doses.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Perspectives from Coaches and Professionals</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li>
            <strong>Phil Daru (Strength & Conditioning Coach):</strong> Daru has emphasized the importance of staying properly hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance. He’s noted, “Electrolytes help fighters maintain proper muscle function and reduce cramping, enabling them to push harder during intense training blocks.”
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4">
            <strong>Dr. Andy Galpin (Exercise Physiologist):</strong> Galpin has discussed hydration strategies extensively, stating that “It’s not just about water—electrolyte balance can affect how muscles fire and how the brain communicates with the body, both critical in fast-paced combat environments.”
          </li>
          <li className="mt-4">
            <strong>Firas Zahabi (MMA Coach, Tristar Gym):</strong> Zahabi has mentioned that fighters who experience frequent cramps or fatigue may benefit from adjusting their electrolyte intake. “You need every advantage in the ring. Stable electrolyte levels can help keep you sharp and consistent.”

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Potential Drawbacks and Considerations</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
          <li><strong>Over-Supplementation:</strong> Excessive electrolyte intake, especially sodium, can lead to digestive issues and, in rare cases, hypernatremia (high blood sodium levels).</li>
          <li className="mt-4"><strong>Caloric and Sugar Content:</strong> Some electrolyte beverages contain added sugars and calories. Opt for low-sugar or sugar-free products if you’re watching weight and body composition.</li>
          <li className="mt-4"><strong>Individual Differences:</strong> Sweating rates vary. Some athletes lose more sodium and may need higher replacement levels. Experimentation and possibly consulting a nutrition professional can help dial in personal electrolyte needs.</li>
