        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">What Are Adaptogens?</h2>
        <p>
          Adaptogens are substances—often herbs or mushrooms—that help the body manage stress more effectively. Rather than pushing you above your natural limits, adaptogens aim to restore balance. For fighters, who juggle intense physical training with psychological stress, adaptogens may:

          <li>Reduce mental fatigue and support focus</li>
          <li>Promote balanced energy without harsh stimulants</li>
          <li>Support healthy stress hormone levels, aiding recovery</li>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Ashwagandha: The Stress-Relief Powerhouse</h2>
        <p>
          Ashwagandha (Withania somnifera) is a staple in Ayurvedic medicine, renowned for its calming yet energizing effects. Research published in the <em>Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition</em> (2015) found that supplementing with ashwagandha improved VO2 max and muscle strength in healthy adults.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          By potentially lowering cortisol (the body’s primary stress hormone), ashwagandha may help athletes recover faster, sleep better, and maintain steady energy levels during intensive training blocks.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">Rhodiola Rosea: The Endurance Enhancer</h2>
        <p>
          Rhodiola Rosea is an Arctic root used traditionally to combat fatigue and improve stamina. A study in the <em>International Journal of Sport Nutrition and Exercise Metabolism</em> (2004) indicated that Rhodiola supplementation could enhance endurance exercise performance, reducing perceived exertion.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
          For kickboxers, whose training involves sustained bursts of effort, Rhodiola’s potential to combat mental and physical fatigue might translate into better focus during sparring and more productive conditioning sessions.

          Both Ashwagandha and Rhodiola share common adaptogenic qualities:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mt-2">
          <li><strong>Balance Stress Response:</strong> Adaptogens help modulate the body’s stress reaction, potentially improving resilience and reducing anxiety before big matches.</li>
          <li className="mt-4"><strong>Improve Recovery:</strong> By supporting hormonal balance and reducing mental fatigue, these herbs may indirectly aid recovery, making it easier to bounce back after hard training.</li>
          <li className="mt-4"><strong>Enhanced Mental Clarity:</strong> Sharper focus and reduced “brain fog” can help fighters stay alert and tactical throughout training and competition.</li>
